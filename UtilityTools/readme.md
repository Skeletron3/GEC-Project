# UtilityTools

## cls

A single binary shortcut to clear but usuable everywhere as it doesn't use `alias`

## simpleshell

A shell which can have a common prefix

For example `sshell git` will read the subcommand in stdin and then run git with those parameters without having to retype git all the time this is good for using a path to something when it becomes annoying to retype everything
